% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in

% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

\section{Solution}

To solve these issues, we propose a modular architecture from which will stem a unified platform in which the benchmarks can be run. The main benefits of such a platform are twofold: to provide a common ground in which the middlewares can be benchmarked to ensure equal an playing field, and to ease the addition of other subsequent middlewares. This is achieved by factoring the common elements that go in the creation of any benchmarking application.
