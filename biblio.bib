  abstract = {Middleware is being extensively used in Internet of Things (IoT) deployments and is available in a variety of flavors. Despite this extensive use and diversity, a fair comparison of the benefits, disadvantages, and performance of each middleware platform is missing. This comparison is relevant to support the decision process for IoT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a set of qualitative and quantitative dimensions for benchmarking IoT middleware. We use the publication\textendash{}subscription of a large dataset as use case inspired by a smart city scenario to compare two middleware platforms with standard ambition: FIWARE and oneM2M. We take these metrics and use case and systematically compare the two middleware platforms in the wild. We identify inefficiencies in implementations and characterize performance variations throughout the day, showing that the metrics may also be used for monitoring. Furthermore, we apply the same metrics and use case to two brokers set up in a controlled environment, providing infrastructure- and networking-independent insights. Finally, we summarize useful practical know-how acquired in the process that can speed up entrance into the topic and avoid configuration and implementation pitfalls that impact performance.},

  abstract = {Middleware is being extensively used in Internet of Things (IoT) deployments and is available in a variety of flavors - from general-purpose community-driven middleware and telco-developed Machine-to-Machine (M2M) middleware to middleware targeting specific deployments. Despite this extensive use and diversity, little is known about the benefits, disadvantages, and performance of each middleware platform and how the different platforms compare with each other. This comparison is especially relevant to help the design and dimensioning of IoT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a set of qualitative dimensions and quantitative metrics that can be used for bench-marking IoT middleware. We use the publication-subscription of a large dataset as use case inspired by a smart city scenario to compare two middleware platforms. The methodology enables us to systematically compare the two middleware platforms. Further, we are able to use our approach to identify inefficiencies in implementations and to characterize performance variations throughout the day, showing that the metrics may also be used for monitoring.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) envisages a future in which digital and physical things or objects (e.g., smartphones, TVs, cars) can be connected by means of suitable information and communication technologies, to enable a range of applications and services. The IoT's characteristics, including an ultra-large-scale network of things, device and network level heterogeneity, and large numbers of events generated spontaneously by these things, will make development of the diverse applications and services a very challenging task. In general, middleware can ease a development process by integrating heterogeneous computing and communications devices, and supporting interoperability within the diverse applications and services. Recently, there have been a number of proposals for IoT middleware. These proposals mostly addressed wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a key component of IoT, but do not consider RF identification (RFID), machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), other three core elements in the IoT vision. In this paper, we outline a set of requirements for IoT middleware, and present a comprehensive review of the existing middleware solutions against those requirements. In addition, open research issues, challenges, and future research directions are highlighted.},
